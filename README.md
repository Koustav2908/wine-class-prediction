# üç∑ Wine class Prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project focuses on classifying the cultivar (variety) of wine based on it's chemical properties from the `Wine dataset` provided by `sklearn.datasets.load_wine()`. Two classification machine learning models are used to compare them, Support Vector Machines (`SVM`), and K-Nearest Nesighbors (`KNN`). The project is hosted with [Streamlit](https://wine-class-prediction.streamlit.app/).

## üíª About the dataset

The wine data is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy by three different cultivators. There are thirteen different measurements taken for different constituents found in the three types of wine.

Summary of the dataset

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow of the project

-   **Loading dataset**: The dataset is loaded as a pandas `DataFrame` object from `sklearn.datasets.load_wine()`.
-   **EDA**: A little analysis is done to see what's in the data.
-   **Split**: Since there were no missing or duplicate data, the data is split into train (80%) and test (20%) set.
-   **Train the models**:
    1. _SVM_: A simple SVM model from `sklearn.svm.SVC()` is used to train the model using default parameters.
    2. _KNN_: A model of K-Nearest Neighbors from `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier()` is trained using a `n_neighbors` value of 3.
-   **Initial Results**: The results are not that prominent because we didn't use any preprocessing techniques.
    1. _SVM_: An accuracy of `81%` was reached when evaluated on the test set which had 36 records.
    2. _KNN_: KNN reached an accuracy of `81%` from the same test set.
-   **Preprocessing**: `Z-score` normalization technique is used as `scaler` to rescale data to have a mean of 0, and standard deviation of 1.
-   **Scaled Results**:
    1. _SVM_: SVM reached an accuracy increased to `100%`, whcih is prominent.
    2. _KNN_: Accuracy of `94%` is achived after Z-score normalization was used.
-   **Saving models**: The two models and scaler is saved into a `pickle` file using joblib.
-   **Website**: The models are hosted using `Streamlit`. Users can go to the website and enter wine details and get output prediction of class 0, 1, or 2.
